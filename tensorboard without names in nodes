'''
Draw a simple tensorboard graph.

This code was written in Python 2.7 version.

In terminal, insert following commands
$ python file_name.py
$ tensorboard --logdir=your/path/to/graph

Then :yourhostname:6006/
There seemed to occur no scalr data found error. But this was actually not an error. 
Because there was nothing to present scalars in this code.
It presents only a graph of nodes.
So just go to graph section and check out how tensorboard draws graphs; nothing in the other sections.
